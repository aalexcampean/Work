    In a Transactional Execution if any test fails the execution is aborted 
	and all remaining tests are marked as blocked.
  </p>
  <p>
	For example, let's suppose we have tests A, B, C that are run in this 
	order. If Transactional Execution option is marked and test A fails then A 
	is marked with result status 'Failed'. And the tests B and C are not execute 
	but have their result status updated to 'Blocked'.
  </p>
  <p>
	This option is useful in situations where you need to save resource if 
	any test fails or when you have a scenario where the results of a test 
	execution provide information for the others tests.
