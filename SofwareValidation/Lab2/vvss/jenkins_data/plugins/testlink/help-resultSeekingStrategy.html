        The plug-in has different strategies for finding results. Here you can 
        add the strategy that best fits your automation scenario. You can add 
        more than one strategy too, but it is not very common environments 
        with more than one strategy (a e.g. of such environments, would be 
        a Maven project with JUnit and TestNG tests).
