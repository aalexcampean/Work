# University + Other Projects

This is the repository housing all the projects I've completed during my university years. Moreover, it will also house the app I've developed with another colleague in an IOS Development internship in the 2nd year. This is not to say I won't add other relevant projects in the future so I just wanted to emphasize that it is still a work in process.

For any other non-coding-related projects, check the CV attached where I'll describe or link some of the other relevant work which has shaped me into the professional I am today.
