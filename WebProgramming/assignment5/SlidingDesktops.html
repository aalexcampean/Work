            <h1>Madagascar</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Madagascar</b>, a country famed for its lemurs, massive baobab trees, birding, and jungles, offers visitors a rich playground to explore.
                While traveling Madagascar is challenging, it’s also incredibly rewarding. The travel trail here isn’t well-worn,
                which means visitors get a much more rugged, unique experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are sweeping canyons and gorges, grand waterfalls, and a diverse landscape that spans the entire island.
                One day you’re in a tropical jungle, the next you’re in an arid plain, and a few hours later you’re on a pristine beach.
                The scenery here is unlike any other destination I’ve been to. Plus, there really are a seemingly endless variety of cute lemurs!

            <h1>Bolivia</h1>
            <p>
                There is no other place like Bolivia. Dubbed a country of extremes, that goes from sweltering Amazon lowlands to frozen cold mountain peaks, you can experience all kinds of climate in one country!
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Bolivia</b> encompasses two of the South America’s biggest draws: the Andes and the Amazon.
                The highlands are the brutal crown, capped with blinding salt, dusty desert, exhausted volcanoes and high altitude lakes.
                These harsh landscapes are softened by colourful Aymara attire, long-lashed llamas and the bustle of a market in a city plaza.
                Descending into the valleys, the climate becomes springlike, water erupts from the rocks and brown scenes turn deep green – giving way to true jungle, wrapping travellers in a restorative blanket of heat and humidity after the chill, arid Altiplano.
                The oxygen rich Amazon replenishes lungs leaden from the thin air of the Andes.

            <h1>Morocco</h1>
            <p>
                Chaotic. Colorful. Eye-opening. Visiting Morocco is an intense experience.
                Time there is challenging, but it is also a reminder that the best part of travel is embracing the uncomfortable.
                Morocco is a gateway to Africa and a country of dizzying diversity. Here you'll find epic mountain ranges, ancient cities, sweeping deserts – and warm hospitality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once part of the Carthaginian Empire, the first independent Moroccan state emerged around 225 BCE as the Berber kingdom of Mauretania. That kingdom eventually became a Roman province, though, by the 7th century CE, Muslim conquest of North Africa was in full swing.
                A French Protectorate from 1912-1956, Morocco gained its independence in 1956 and has been an independent state ever since.
                You'll love your time in <b>Morocco</b>. You'll gorge on couscous, drink your body weight in mint tea, hike, and absorb the hectic sights and sounds of the country.
                From the high Atlas Mountains to the desert to the coasts, Morocco is a marvelous country that mesmerizes. True, the sprawling and disorderly medinas can test your patience, but they reward your senses each and every visit.
