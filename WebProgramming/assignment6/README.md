In this lab you will have to develop a server-side web application in PHP. The web application has to manipulate a Mysql database with 1 to 3 tables and should implement the following base operations on these tables: select, insert, delete, update. Also the web application must use AJAX for getting data asynchronously from the web server and the web application should contain at least 5 web pages (client-side html or server-side php).

For the database, you can use the mysql database on www.scs.ubbcluj.ro. On this myql server you have an account, a password and a database, all identical to your username and password on the SCS network.

Please make sure that you avoid sql-injection attacks when working with the database.

Have in mind the user experience when you implement the problem:
    add different validation logic for input fields
    do not force the user to input an ID for an item if he wants to delete/edit/insert it; this should happen automatically (e.g. the user clicks an item from a list, and a page/modal prepopulated with the data for that particular item is opened, where the user can edit it)
    add confirmation when the user deletes/cancels an item
    do a bare minimum CSS that at least aligns the various input fields
